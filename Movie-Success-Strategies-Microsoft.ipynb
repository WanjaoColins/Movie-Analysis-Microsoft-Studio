    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The core business problem at hand pertains to Microsoft's ambitious foray into the movie industry with the establishment of a new movie studio. The key pain points that the company is grappling with include the lack of expertise and experience in the movie-making domain. Microsoft is faced with uncertainties regarding what types of films are currently thriving at the box office and how to translate these insights into actionable recommendations for their new movie studio. \n",
    "\n",
    "In light of these challenges, the chosen data analysis questions aim to address the following critical aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which movie genres are currently most successful at the box office?**\n",
    "   - The business is interested in understanding the most lucrative genres to guide its movie production strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How do audience ratings correlate with box office performance across different genres?**\n",
    "   - By examining the relationship between ratings and box office gross, the business can gauge the impact of audience preferences on financial success.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are the trends in box office performance over time for various genres?**\n",
    "   - Recognizing the evolution of genre popularity and performance over time is crucial for making informed business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are indispensable from a business perspective as they provide Microsoft's new movie studio with the essential insights required to strategically enter the competitive movie industry. By addressing these questions, the company can identify profitable genres, tailor their content to align with audience preferences, and adapt to shifting market trends. Ultimately, these insights are invaluable for ensuring that Microsoft's new movie studio can make informed decisions and increase its chances of success in this dynamic and ever-evolving sector."

    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets for this project are sourced from three main datasets: `imdb.title.basics`, `imdb.title.ratings`, and `bom.movie.gross`. These datasets have been selected because they are integral to addressing the data analysis questions at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **imdb.title.basics:**\n",
    "   - This dataset provides information about movies, including titles and genres. Genres are particularly significant as they are central to the analysis of which movie genres are performing well at the box office.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **imdb.title.ratings:**\n",
    "   - This dataset includes data on IMDb ratings for movies. These ratings are crucial for understanding audience preferences and examining their relationship with box office performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **bom.movie.gross:**\n",
    "   - This dataset contains information about the financial aspects of movies, including box office gross. Box office gross serves as a key variable to evaluate movie performance in financial terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample within these datasets encompasses a broad range of movies spanning different genres, release years, and production scales. The variables of interest primarily include:\n",
    "- **Title:** The title of the movie, which is a common identifier across the datasets.\n",
    "- **Genres:** Categorical variables that represent the genres to which a movie belongs, facilitating genre-specific analysis.\n",
    "- **IMDb Ratings:** Numerical variables indicating audience ratings, which are essential for understanding audience satisfaction and preferences.\n",
    "- **Box Office Gross:** Numerical variables representing the financial success of movies, serving as a key metric to evaluate box office performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three datasets will be used in tandem to answer the data analysis questions and provide actionable insights for Microsoft's new movie studio."
